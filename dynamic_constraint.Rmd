Given the heterogeneity of contemporary American culture, how do individuals maintian consistent attitudes over time? While stable attitudes are often assumed to be the default, with change being the thing necessary to explain, decades of cultural research suggest that people are much more variable than this assumption expects. 

At the same time, some people do demonstrate remarkable stability in their attitudes over time, and certain attitudes seem to predict behaviors over time, including patterns of affiliation, which we would not expect if attitudes were temporary constructs strongly influenced by situational factors [].

In this paper, I argue that institutions facilitate the structuring of attitudes in ways that allow them to persist even when that institutional affilaition disappears.
